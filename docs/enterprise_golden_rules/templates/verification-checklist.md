| Violation | Impact | Fix |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Missing PK constraint | BI tools can't auto-discover relationships | Add `PRIMARY KEY ... NOT ENFORCED` |
| No CDF enabled | Can't use incremental processing | Add `delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true` |
| Missing deduplication | MERGE failures in production | Add `orderBy().dropDuplicates()` |
| Hardcoded cluster | Cost overruns, maintenance burden | Use serverless environment |

### Medium Severity (Fix Within Sprint)

| Violation | Impact | Fix |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Missing table comment | Genie/AI can't understand data | Add COMMENT with business context |
| Missing column comments | Self-service analytics impaired | Add COMMENT to all columns |
| No schema YAML | Schema drift risk | Create YAML definition |
| Few DLT expectations | Quality issues not detected | Add 5+ expectations per table |

### Low Severity (Fix When Possible)

| Violation | Impact | Fix |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Short comments (<50 chars) | Limited AI understanding | Expand with business context |
| Missing domain tag | Catalog browsing harder | Add `domain` TBLPROPERTY |
| No quarantine table | Failed records lost | Add quarantine pattern |

### Semantic Layer & ML/AI Violations

| Violation | Severity | Impact | Fix |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----|
| `name` field in Metric View YAML | High | Deployment fails | Remove `name` field (v1.1) |
| Transitive joins in Metric View | High | Query errors | Use direct joins only |
| DATE type in TVF parameters | High | Parameter conversion fails | Use STRING for dates |
| Missing OBO context detection | High | Agent evaluation fails | Add environment variable check |
| Missing Genie Space resources | High | Permission denied errors | Declare in AuthPolicy |
| No AI Guardrails (external) | Medium | Safety risks | Enable for external endpoints |
| Missing rate limiting | Medium | Cost overruns | Configure limits per endpoint |
