## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Which rules allow exceptions?**
A: Check the "Exceptions" section of each rule in the Golden Rules document. Rules marked "None" do not allow exceptions.

**Q: How long can an exception last?**
A: Temporary (up to 90 days), Extended (requires quarterly review), or Permanent (requires executive approval and Platform Architect sign-off).

**Q: What if my exception is denied?**
A: You may appeal to the Architecture Review Board with additional justification. Alternatively, work with the Platform Team on alternative solutions.

**Q: Can I start work before the exception is approved?**
A: No. Implementing non-compliant code without an approved exception is a policy violation and may block deployment.

**Q: What happens if I exceed my exception expiration?**
A: The exception becomes void, and affected resources are flagged as non-compliant. This may block future deployments and impact team compliance scores.
