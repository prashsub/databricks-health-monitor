# ML Inference Pipeline - All Models
# Runs batch inference for ALL trained ML models and stores predictions
#
# Storage Architecture:
#   - Feature Tables: ${catalog}.${feature_schema} (e.g., system_gold_features)
#   - Predictions: ${catalog}.${feature_schema}.{model}_predictions
#   - Models: Unity Catalog ${catalog}.${feature_schema}.{model_name}
#
# Models Scored (18 total):
#   - Cost (5): anomaly, budget, job_cost, chargeback, commitment
#   - Security (4): threat, exfiltration, privilege, user_behavior
#   - Performance (3): query, warehouse, regression
#   - Reliability (3): failure, duration, sla_breach
#   - Quality (3): drift, schema_change, freshness
